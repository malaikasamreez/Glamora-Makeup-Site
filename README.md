## Business Constraints

1. _User Roles & Permissions_

   - Only authenticated users can browse, add to cart, and checkout.
   - Only administrators can access the admin panel and manage products.

2. _Data Security_

   - User credentials and authentication state are stored in localStorage (for demo purposes; not suitable for production).
   - Sensitive actions (e.g., product deletion) require confirmation.

3. _Product Management_

   - Product information must be complete and accurate (name, price, description, image, category, stock).
   - Stock levels are tracked and displayed to users.

4. _Checkout Process_

   - Users must provide valid shipping and payment information to complete orders.
   - Orders are simulated; in a real-world scenario, orders would be sent to a backend for processing.

5. _Responsiveness & Accessibility_

   - The platform must be accessible and usable on all devices.
   - UI must be intuitive and visually appealing to encourage sales.

6. _Performance_
   - Product and category data are fetched asynchronously for a smooth user experience.
